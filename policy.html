        <h5>
          Our Privacy Policy<br>
          <br>
        </h5>
        
        10. How your personal data is used.  Along with your Operator, we are committed to ensuring the privacy of all users of our market kiosks. Here, we will explain how information collected from you is processed, held and stored.  This document explains how we use your personal data.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.1. This section provides you with information about:<br>
        <br>
        
        a) what personal data is held and processed;<br>
        <br>
        
        b) in respect of personal data that did not come from you directly, where that data was obtained, and what types of data have been collected;<br>
        <br>
        
        c) the purposes for which we may process your personal data; and<br>
        <br>
        
        d) the legal grounds on which your data is processed.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.2. As a customer using markets and kiosks, you have options as to how to shop. You may choose to set up an account with your Operator, make a lump-sum prepayment using your credit or debit card, and draw down from this sum each time you shop. Or, you can simply pay each time you shop.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.3. Account data. If you choose to set up an account with your Operator, your Operator may process information about you that you provide as part of the account set-up ("account data"). This account data may include your name, address, email address, user name and password, your product purchases, and how much you have spent each month. If you are in the U.S. and would like to make a deposit using 32market.com, you have the option to enter in your credit card information to save for future deposits.  This account data may be processed each time you shop. Your Operator may use this information for the purposes of creating your account, administering your account and purchases, and for sending you receipts for your purchases by email. Please note that, when using the kiosk, neither we nor your Operator collects or holds or has access to payment details such as your debit or credit card number, bank account number or sort code. The legal basis for this processing is for the purposes of performing our contract with your Operator, which Operator is taking steps at your request as part of entering into a contract with you.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.4. Purchase Data. If you do not have an account with the Operator and are simply making a one-off purchase, none of your personal data will be collected.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.5. Special categories of data. When you create an account, you can choose whether or not you want to activate the digital fingerprint payment / login process. You do not need to activate the digital fingerprint option in order to open and use an account, and the use of such function is at your sole discretion.  If you do want to use this function, you will need to provide certain biometric data around the impression of your fingerprint.  The data gathered from the impression of your fingerprint is only a stored mathematical representation—never images of your finger itself. This data is used to allow you to login securely instead of entering your user ID and password. Using the fingerprint payment process is optional, and as such, requires your proactive consent and acknowledgment to activate this function.<br>
        <br>
        
        Other data processing that we may carry out<br>
        <br>
        
        10.6. Website data. We may process data about your use of our website and services ("website data"). The website data may include your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views and website navigation paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your service use. The source of the website data is our analytics tracking system. This website data may be processed for the purposes of analysing the use of the website and services. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely security, monitoring and improving our website and services.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.7. Enquiry data. We may process information contained in any enquiry you submit to us regarding our products or services ("enquiry data"). The enquiry data may be processed for the purposes of offering, marketing, improving, and selling relevant products and/or services to you. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely dealing with and responding to your enquiry appropriately.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.8. Correspondence data. We may process information contained in or relating to any communication that you send directly to us as opposed to sending to your Operator ("correspondence data"). The correspondence data may include the communication content and metadata associated with the communication. Our website will generate the metadata associated with communications made using the website contact forms. The correspondence data may be processed for the purposes of communicating with you and record-keeping.  The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the proper administration of our website and business and communications with users.<br>
        <br>
        
        10.9. Other processing activities. In addition to the specific purposes for which your personal data may be processed as set out above, your personal data may also be processed where such processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, governmental request, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.<br>

        <br>
        
        11.3. Where your personal data is provided to any third party. Where your personal data is shared with any third party, this data processing is protected by appropriate safeguards including a suitable data processing agreement with that third party. In the context of an onward transfer, as a Privacy Shield organization, 32M has the responsibility for the processing of personal information we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.  As a Privacy Shield organization, we shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if our agents process such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any damage.<br>
        <br>
        
        11.4. To comply with legal obligations. In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data detailed above, your personal data may be disclosed where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another individual. This may include disclosing your personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities.<br>
        <br>
        
        12. Transfers of your personal data outside of the European Economic Area.  32M is situated in the United States of America. As such, your data will be stored on our secure servers provided by Amazon Web Services situated in the United States of America.  This includes all data generated in the EEA.  In all cases, transfers outside of the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards and contracts.<br>
        <br>
        
        13. Retaining and deleting personal data.<br>
        <br>
        
        13.1. Processed personal data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary.  Your Operator may maintain your personal data as part of the Operator’s account management system, but again, will only maintain such data so long as you continue to be an active customer for the Operator.  Dormant accounts will be deleted in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable regulations.<br>
        <br>
        
        13.2. Unless we contact you and obtain your consent for us to retain your personal data for a longer period, we will retain and delete your personal data as follows:<br>
        <br>
        
        a) Account data (including special categories of personal data) in respect to a particular account will be anonymised if we find that there has been no activity on that account for 6 consecutive months or more.<br>
        <br>
        
        b) Website data will be retained for 12 months following the date of last contact or dealing with you, at the end of which period it will be deleted from the system.<br>

        <br>
        
        13.3. We may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.<br>
        <br>
        
        14. Updates.<br>

        14.3. At our sole discretion, we may notify you of changes to this Policy by email.<br>
        <br>
        
        15. Your rights.<br>
        <br>
        
        15.1. You may instruct your Operator to provide you with any personal information held about you.  Provision of such information will be subject to:<br>
        <br>
        
        a) your request not being found to be unfounded or excessive, in which case a charge may apply; and<br>
        <br>
        
        b) the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (requirements for this purpose may vary from Operator to Operator as the result of jurisdictional differences, but generally a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address will suffice).<br>
        <br>
        
        15.2. Personal information may be withheld at your request to the extent permitted by law.<br>
        <br>
        
        15.3. You may instruct us at any time not to process your personal information for marketing purposes.  In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to use of your personal information for marketing purposes, or you will be provided with an opportunity to opt out of the use of your personal information for marketing purposes.<br>
        <br>
        
        15.4. Your right to access your data. You have the right to ask to confirm whether or not we process your personal data and, to have access to the personal data, and any additional information. That additional information includes the purposes for which we process your data, the categories of personal data held and the recipients of that personal data.

        <br>
        
        15.5. Your right to rectification. If any personal data about you is inaccurate, you have the right to have these inaccuracies rectified. Where necessary for the purposes of the data processing, you also have the right to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.<br>

        15.6. Your right to erasure. In certain circumstances you have the right to have personal data erased. This will be done without undue delay. These circumstances include the following: it is no longer necessary to hold the personal data in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw your consent to any data processing which requires consent; the data processing is for direct marketing purposes; and any personal data has been unlawfully processed. However, there are certain general exclusions of the right to erasure, including where processing is necessary (i) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; (ii) for compliance with a legal obligation; or (iii) for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.<br>
        <br>
        
        15.7. Your right to restrict data processing. In certain circumstances you have the right for the processing of your personal data to be restricted. This is the case where: you do not think that the personal data is accurate; your data is being processed unlawfully, but you do not want your data to be erased; it is no longer necessary to hold your personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still require that personal data in relation to a legal claim; and you have objected to processing, and are waiting for that objection to be verified.

However, we will only process it for other reasons: with your consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.<br>
        <br>
        
        15.8. Your right to object to data processing.

We will not however process your data in this way if we believe that it may pose a threat to the security of the data.<br>
        <br>
        
        15.11. Your right to object for statistical purposes. You can object to us processing your personal data for statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for performing a task carried out for reasons of public interest.

        <br>

        15.14. Right to withdraw consent. To the extent that the legal basis we are relying on for processing your personal data is consent, you are entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing your data prior to the withdrawal.<br>

        15.15. Exercising your rights.  In addition to the other methods specified above, you may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to the Operator who will, if necessary, notify us of the exercise of your rights.<br>

        15.16. Point of contact data. If you are employed by one of our corporate clients such as our Operators, which has a contractual arrangement with Three Square Market for the provision of services, we may use your information such as your name, email address, telephone number and employment details (the “point of contact data”) to enable us to:<br>
        <br>

The Operator is the controller of any point of contact data entered into our system. In order to fulfil our obligations to the Operator, we may receive your data in respect of such points of contact direct from the Operator.  We will process any such personal data referred to in this paragraph 5.17 strictly in accordance with the instructions of the Operator, not the individual point of contact, including sharing all such data with the main contractor.  The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests in meeting our contractual commitments to the Operator, in managing and administering our relationship and contract with the Operator, and in marketing our products and services to the Operator.<br>
